When writing my generatedata.py file, I made sure to make my file reusable for other aplication. I use other datasets in it ant it would work properly. It takes the input information and generates a random dataset as well as three different types of alligns. it genereates aligns that should allign once by taking them from the part of the dataset the only occurs once. the ones that allign twice are just generated by pulling them form the part of the dataset that occurs twice, and the ones that dont allign are just randomly generated

The alligns will not be exactly 10 15 and 75 percent because the randomly generated might allign by chance and when the dataset is 600000 characters long there is a good chance that a random will allign

I spent close to 5 hours writing this first part, but a lot of this time was just spent messing around with things to see if they would improve it's function.
